      Hello! My name is Francis Lao. I have experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am currently looking for a full stack development position. I am a Computer Science from New Jersey City University. I currently have both an Associate's and Bachelor's degree while currently enrolled in Rutgers Full Stack Coding Camp. I live in Jersey City, New Jersey. Outside of coding, I personally enjoy playing card games, write, and do arts and crafts.
