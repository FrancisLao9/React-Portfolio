      Hello! My name is Francis Lao. I was born in the United States when my parents decided to settle from the Philippines.
      I am a Computer Science from New Jersey City University. 
      I currently have both an Associate's and Bachelor's degree while currently enrolled in Rutgers Full Stack Coding Camp. 
      I live in Jersey City, New Jersey. Outside of coding, I personally enjoy playing card games, write, and do arts and crafts.
